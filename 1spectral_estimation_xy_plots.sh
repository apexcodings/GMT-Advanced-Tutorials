# Now we can use $bounds in gmt math to make a sampling points file for gmt sample1d:
gmt math -T$bounds/1 -N1/0 T = samp.x #-N0/1 specifies 2 number of columns and the time column is the first one, 
#T: Table with t-coordinates

# Now we can resample the gmt projected satellite data:
# sample1d reads a multi-column ASCII [or binary] data set from file [or standard input] 
# and interpolates the time-series or spatial profile at locations where the user needs the values.
# -Nknotfile: knotfile is an optional ASCII file with the time locations where the data set will be resampled in the first column. 
gmt sample1d sat.pg -Nsamp.x > samp_sat.pg

#the same procedure applied to the ship data could alias information at shorter wavelengths.  
#So we have to use "gmt filter1d" to resample the ship data. Since we observed spikes in the ship
# data, we use a median filter to clean up the ship values.
#filter1d is a general time domain filter for multiple column time series data. 
#The user specifies which column is the time (i.e., the independent variable).

# Now to do the cross-spectra, assuming that the ship is the input and the sat is the output 
# data, we do this:
# gmtconvert : -A -> The records from the input files should be pasted horizontally, not appended vertically 
# gmt convert: 2nd column of samp_ship.pg and 2nd column of samp_sat.pg is pasted horizontally

#spectrum1d reads X [and Y] values from the first [and second] columns on standard input [or x[y]file]. 
#These values are treated as timeseries X(t) [Y(t)] sampled at equal intervals spaced dt units apart. 
#There may be any number of lines of input. spectrum1d will create file[s] containing auto- [and cross- ] 
#spectral density estimates by Welchâ€™s method of ensemble averaging of multiple overlapped windows, 
#using standard error estimates from Bendat and Piersol.
#-S256 specifies number of samples per window for ensemble averaging
#-D1 sets the spacing between samples in the time series
#-W writes wavelength rather than frequency
#-C: read the first two columns of input as samples of two time series
# -T: Disable the writing of a single composite results file to stdout.

# Now we want to plot the spectra. The following commands will plot the ship and sat 
# power in one diagram and the coherency on another diagram, both on the same page.  
# We end by adding a map legends and some labels on the plots.
# For that purpose we often use -Jx1i and specify positions in inches directly:
